title: $:/plugins/btheado/BrowserStorage/BackupInstructions

Have you downloaded a backup file recently?

Click this button {{$:/core/ui/Buttons/save-wiki}} to download a new backup copy of your wiki.

Downloaded backups provide extra copies of the tiddler data stored in browser local storage. The backup is a single, self-contained html file and it also includes all the source code required to run this wiki.

Here is a summary of the tiddlers in browser local storage:

|!Loaded at startup|<$link to="$:/plugins/btheado/BrowserStorage/TiddlersLoadedFromBrowserStorage"><$text text={{{[enlist{$:/temp/BrowserStorage/Log}count[]]}}}/> tiddlers</$link>|
|!Saved since startup|<$link to="$:/plugins/btheado/BrowserStorage/TiddlersChangedSinceStartup"><$text text={{{[haschanged[]subfilter{$:/config/BrowserStorage/SaveFilter}] -$:/config/BrowserStorage/Enabled :and[count[]]}}}/> tiddlers</$link>|
|!Total (unique)|<$text text={{{[enlist{$:/temp/BrowserStorage/Log}] [haschanged[]subfilter{$:/config/BrowserStorage/SaveFilter}] -$:/config/BrowserStorage/Enabled :and[unique[]count[]]}}}/> tiddlers|

The browser local storage tiddlers are not present in the source url: {{$:/info/url/full}}, but they will be saved whenever you download a backup copy {{$:/core/ui/Buttons/save-wiki}}.

If you don't have access to update the wiki file at {{$:/info/url/full}}, then consider performing the following steps:

# download a backup {{$:/core/ui/Buttons/save-wiki}}
# copy the download to a documents or some other folder folder
# load it into the browser via a file:/// url (i.e. double clicking the file in a file explorer should open it in the browser).

If you do have access to update the wiki file at {{$:/info/url/full}}, then it is best to

# Overwrite it periodically with the latest downloaded backup {{$:/core/ui/Buttons/save-wiki}}.
# Upon reload any data already in the wiki file will be cleared from the browser storage.

Beware of the privacy implications of browser local storage tiddlers and file:/// urls. The browser storage contents are shared across all file:/// urls. This means any html loaded from a file:/// url can read those browser storage tiddlers.
